# HealthclusiveSpring

The purpose of the assignment is essentially to showcase new acquired skills, as well as to put them into practise. Personally, I wanted to not the only test my abilities but also begin to create something great with a significant meaning behind it. 

I have become increasingly more aware of how important mental health is, as well as accessibility. Seeing the way in which people can enjoy access to therapy via app was a huge inspiration for me considering it's not been popularised in Europe yet. Additionally, it has made me realise that people with disabilities may struggle with accessing such resources and are at a high risk of being overlooked. 

Having discovered that, I came up with an idea of creating an app that will enable people with vision loss, as well as hearing and speech impairment to get the best level of access to those type of services. My intention is to create an app, where fully qualified therapists, specialising in a particular condition would be paired with a user, accordingly, based on their needs and requirements. My hopes are that it’ll create a safe space and opportunity for those who previously might have felt like they don’t have it. 
I was eager to challenge my new skills, considering I have never coded before. I was fully aware that it’s not going to be an easy task, so I did feel a little scared. However, decided to start with celebrating small victories, knowing that it will help to overcome any potential blocks. 

I feel like my journey through the project has been a rollercoaster to say the least. Having support from trainers was invaluable.
Beginning's honestly felt a little intimidating, which was something that I was expecting considering I haven't been coding for long. I have lost a huge part of the code and had to start again. The silver lining of that was, I paid close attention to the branches and was very careful with each step. 

Testing the code has been challenging, I’m glad I got an opportunity to practice it. One mistake that I did was, for example typing my workbench password in lower case letter instead of capital letters, but then paid a close attention to that.

I have learnt so much over this process.  And as much as I could’ve spent forever on tweaking it, I have put a lot of effort into everything.
I certainly want to work on expanding the project, as I believe in the concept itself. I want to add a database of users and work on interaction between the tables. It can then be used not only mental health app but cover all aspects of the industry, serving as a great tool for medical professionals to access those who for whatever reason may struggle with seeing them in person. Perfecting the process of matching the right therapist/professional with the user will be crucial in that. Regarding testing, I could certainly incorporate Service Integration testing.

Installation and running:
Needed: Java, Maven, Spring Boot, Eclipse IDE, Postman, MySql.
After having installed everything, create database in MySql called “therapists” and instruct MySql to use this database.
Before you run the app, make sure that maven dependencies are included: Spring Boot Dev Tools H2 Database Spring Boot Starter Data JPA Spring Boot Starter Web Spring Boot Starter Test Lombok and Testing dependencies: Junit and Mockito.
 Make sure that the URL begins with http://localhost:8080 when executing the requests in postman
